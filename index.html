<h1>Rock Riding Grip Master</h1>

<p>I've always liked trying new things and when I tried rock climbing for the first time
    <br>it was no different. I was at my aunt's house and saw they had a rock wall and
    <br> wondered what the point of it was. One of my cousins showed me that you just find
    <br> ways to climb up the wall. After I had done it a few times he wanted to time me.
    <br> After the first time he timed me that was when I really started to like rock climbing.
</p>

<p>
   When ever I had the opportunity to try rock climbing I always did because my family
   <br> didnt visit my aunt very often because of how far she lived from us. But when we did
   <br> visit that was the first thing I would want to do. After so many years of rock climbing 
   <br> I built up some of an ego, and when ever I could I would show off to my friends that I
   <br> could climb up the wall faster than any of them could. 
</p>
<p>
    Something I've always found interesting is why people use certain types of gear wheth
    <br> it's a belt or a harness. A harness goes around your whole body where as the safety belt only 
    <br> goes around your waist and legs.
